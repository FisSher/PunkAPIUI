# PunkAPIUI
Appium UI tests for PunkAPI

Mini test using appium and punkapi apk (beer related for fun).

To get started you should have pipenv https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/

Once in the project folder you can write: pipenv shell

and then write pipenv install, this will download the modules for you.

To run the tests you should have configured an Android device and appium opened on your computer,
I did mine with Android Studio.

To run the tests type behave and enter.
