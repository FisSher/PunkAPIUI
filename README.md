# PunkAPIUI
Appium UI tests for PunkAPI

Mini test using appium and punkapi apk (beer related for fun).

To get started you should have pipenv https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/

Once in the project folder you can write: pipenv shell

and then write pipenv install, this will download the modules for you.

To run the tests you should have configured an Android device on your computer,
I did mine with Android Studio.
